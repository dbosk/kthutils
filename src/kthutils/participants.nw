\chapter{The course participants listing }

This is the documentation for the [[kthutils.participants]] module.
We want to be able to read out the course participants and the Funka codes for 
the different participants.

We provide two interfaces:
First, a class, [[ParticipantsSession]], through which we interact with the 
participants part of KTH's web.
Second, a CLI, [[cli]], using Typer.
<<participants.py>>=
import json
import logging
import operator
import re
import sys

<<additional imports>>

<<helper functions>>

class ParticipantsSession:
  """
  Maintains a session to the course participants API.
  """
  BASE_URL = <<the Participants service base URL>>

  def __init__(self, username, password):
    """
    Requires `username` and `password` which are the normal credentials for 
    logging in through https://login.ug.kth.se.

    All API requests are performed as this user.
    """
    <<PS constructor>>

  <<PS methods>>

<<set up cli>>

if __name__ == "__main__":
  <<run cli>>
@

The base URL seems to be the following.
<<the Participants service base URL>>=
"https://app.kth.se/studentlistor/kurstillfallen"
@


\section{Tests}

We provide tests for the class.
We create a [[ps]] object and will add test functions to [[<<test functions>>]] 
as we add methods to [[<<PS methods>>]].
<<test participants.py>>=
from kthutils.participants import *
import os

ps = ParticipantsSession(os.environ["KTH_LOGIN"],
                         os.environ["KTH_PASSWD"])

<<test functions>>
@

\begin{pycode}
import json
from kthutils.participants import *

ps = kthutils.participants.ParticipantsSession(os.environ["KTH_LOGIN"],
                                               os.environ["KTH_PASSWD"])
\end{pycode}


\section{The CLI}

We will use Typer to construct the CLI.
We also want to use the pretty-printing of the [[rich]] package.
<<additional imports>>=
from rich import print
import typer
import typing
<<set up cli>>=
cli = typer.Typer(name="participants",
                  help="Interacts with the KTH course participants lists")

<<add commands to cli>>
<<run cli>>=
cli()
@

Typer requires that we use static functions or class methods as commands.
We can't use the methods of an object instance as CLI commands.
Hence, to create the CLI, we can create a function for each command.
This means that we must create an instance of [[ParticipantsSession]] and 
perform the method calls on that in normal functions, one function (command) 
per method.
Each command matches a method call on the [[ps]] object.

However, to create that we need the user's credentials.
We'll use the [[credentials]] module and its [[get_credentials]] function for 
this.
We simply unpack the (username, password) tuple we get and pass it directly to 
[[ParticipantsSession]].
<<additional imports>>=
import kthutils.credentials
<<create UGsession instance ug or exit>>=
ps = ParticipantsSession(*kthutils.credentials.get_credentials())
@


\section{Constructing a session}

All we need for the [[ParticipantsSession]] object is a [[requests]] session to 
the participants web interface.
However, it requires logging in to use it, so we use
[[weblogin.AutologinSession]]
together with the KTH UG login handler
[[weblogin.kth.UGlogin]]
for that.
<<PS constructor>>=
self.__session = weblogin.AutologinSession([
      weblogin.kth.UGlogin(username, password,
                           self.BASE_URL)
  ])
<<additional imports>>=
import weblogin
import weblogin.kth
@


\section{Getting all the course and participant data}

The service seems to have only one API call.
That call yields basically all the data that is then filtered and presented by 
the web interface.

To make things more efficient, we will cache the result of this call.
This way we can call this method instead of storing the data elsewhere to avoid 
web requests.
<<PS methods>>=
@ct.cachedmethod(operator.attrgetter("cache"),
  key=ft.partial(ct.keys.hashkey, "get_all_data"))
def get_all_data(self, course_code, semester):
  """
  Returns all the data from the search results.
  - `course_code` is something like "DD1310" and
  - `semester` is something like "HT2023" (for Autumn 2023).
  """
  data = {
    "courseCode": course_code,
    "term": semester
  }
  response = self.__session.get(f"{self.BASE_URL}"
                      f"/api/studentlistor/courseroundparticipants",
                    params=data)
  try:
    return response.json()
  except Exception as err:
    err.response = response
    raise err
<<PS constructor>>=
self.cache = {}
<<additional imports>>=
import cachetools as ct
import functools as ft
@

The data we get looks like this.
We get a JSON object that has the following keys:
\begin{pycode}
try:
  data = ps.get_all_data("DD1310", "HT2023")
  print(r"\begin{minted}{json}")
  print(json.dumps(list(data.keys()), indent=2))
  print(r"\end{minted}")
except Exception as err:
  print(r"\begin{minted}{text}")
  print(err.response.url)
  print(err.response)
  print(r"\end{minted}")
\end{pycode}

To detect if the format of the returned data changes, we can add a test for it.
<<test functions>>=
def test_get_all_data():
  data = ps.get_all_data("DD1310", "HT2023")
  assert "totalNumberOfParticipants" in data
  assert "courseRounds" in data
  assert "participants" in data
  assert "funkaCountersCombinations" in data
  assert "funkaFlag" in data
  assert "ugdata" in data
  assert "numberOfCourseRoundChanged" in data
@

\section{The data format}

Now let's have a look at what's in these.
We now look at the output of
\begin{minted}{python}
ps.get_all_data("DD1310", "HT2023")
\end{minted}

\begin{pycode}
def print_json(key, data, depth=1):
  if depth > 2:
    return

  section = f"\\{'sub'*depth}section"
  print(section + r"{\texttt{" + key + r"}}")
  try:
    print_keys(data[key], prefix=r"The key \texttt{" + key + r"}")
  except AttributeError:
    print_list(key, data, depth=depth)
  except Exception as err:
    print(r"The following error occurred:")
    print(r"\begin{minted}{text}")
    print(err)
    print(r"\end{minted}")

def print_keys(data, prefix="Each item in the list"):
  json_output = json.dumps(list(data.keys()), indent=2)
  print(prefix + r" contains the following keys:")
  print(r"\begin{minted}{json}")
  print(json_output)
  print(r"\end{minted}")

def print_list(key, data, depth=1):
  if not isinstance(data[key], list):
    print_value(data[key], prefix=r"The key \texttt{" + key + r"}")
    return

  print(r"The key \texttt{" + key + r"} contains a list.")
  try:
    print_keys(data[key][0])
    subdata = data[key][0]
    for key in subdata.keys():
      print_json(key, subdata, depth=depth+1)
  except AttributeError:
    print_value(data[key][0])
  except IndexError:
    print(r"The list is empty.")
  except Exception as err:
    print(r"The following error occurred:")
    print(r"\begin{minted}{text}")
    print(err)
    print(r"\end{minted}")

def print_value(data, prefix="Each item in the list"):
  print(prefix + " has the following type:")
  print(r"\begin{minted}{text}")
  print(type(data))
  print(r"\end{minted}")

for key in data:
  print_json(key, data)
\end{pycode}


\section{Listing course participants}

The first thing we want to do is to be able to list all students that are 
expected to participate in a course.
<<list doc>>=
Lists all students in the list of expected participants.
Returns list of JSON objects (from `list_editable_groups()`).
@

This will be reused a lot in the other methods, so we want to cache it.
It makes sense to cache it as well, since the data can't change.
(Well, we can't change it, and it doesn't change that often.)
<<UG constructor>>=
self.cache = {}
<<UG methods>>=
@ct.cachedmethod(operator.attrgetter("cache"),
  key=ft.partial(ct.keys.hashkey, "list_editable_groups"))
def list_editable_groups(self):
  """
  <<list doc>>
  """
  response = self.__session.get(
      f"{self.BASE_URL}/api/ug/groups?editableBySelf=true")
  return response.json()
@

We can test the function as follows.
<<test functions>>=
def test_list_editable_groups():
  groups = ug.list_editable_groups()
  assert groups
@

Each JSON object in the resulting list has the following format.
\begin{pycode}
import json
import kthutils.ug

ug = kthutils.ug.UGsession(os.environ["KTH_LOGIN"], os.environ["KTH_PASSWD"])
groups = ug.find_group_by_name("edu.courses.DD.DD1317.20222.1.courseresponsible")

print(r"\begin{minted}{json}")
print(json.dumps(list(groups)[0], indent=2))
print(r"\end{minted}")
\end{pycode}

Now, let's add the CLI command function.
We want to print the name and, if it exists, the description for the group; we 
don't want to print everything that we actually get from the function.
<<add commands to cli>>=
@cli.command(name="ls")
def cli_list_groups():
  """
  <<list doc>>
  """
  <<create UGsession instance ug or exit>>
  for group in ug.list_editable_groups():
    name, desc = get_name_desc(group)
    print(f"{name}\t{desc}")
<<helper functions>>=
def get_name_desc(group):
  """
  Returns a tuple (name, desc) containing the name and description, if it 
  exists, for the group `group`. If the group doesn't have a description, the 
  second value is None.
  """
  name = group["name"]

  try:
    desc = group["description"]["en"]
  except KeyError:
    desc = None

  return name, desc
@


\section{Find group by name}

Most of the time we want to find a group by name.
<<find group doc>>=
Searches for a group from `list_editable_groups()` whose name matches the regex 
`name_regex`.
Returns a list of matching groups.
@
<<UG methods>>=
def find_group_by_name(self, name_regex):
  """
  <<find group doc>>
  """
  return filter(lambda group: re.search(name_regex, group["name"]),
                self.list_editable_groups())
@

Each JSON object in the resulting list has the same format as above.

Now, let's add the CLI command function.
We want the argument [[name_regex]] as argument, but we'd also like to have tab 
completion for it.
We use the function [[complete_group_regex]] for the tab completion.
<<add commands to cli>>=
def complete_group(incomplete: str) -> [str]:
  """
  Returns list of strings (group names) that can complete `incomplete`.
  """
  <<create UGsession instance ug or exit>>
  <<return list of filtered group names>>

@cli.command(name="group")
def cli_group(name_regex: str = typer.Argument(...,
                                               help="Regex for group name",
                                               autocompletion=complete_group)):
  """
  <<find group doc>>
  """
  <<create UGsession instance ug or exit>>
  print(list(ug.find_group_by_name(name_regex)))
@

For the autocompletion, we want to return a list of only the names, not the 
full JSON for them, as the function returns.
We would also like to return a help text for each name, namely the human 
readable name that is available from the JSON.
This means that we want to return a list of tuples: the name (which the regex 
match) and the description (human readable).
<<return list of filtered group names>>=
names = []

for group in ug.find_group_by_name(incomplete):
  names.append(get_name_desc(group))

return names
@


\section{Find person by username}

Now we would like to look up user data based on their username.
For one, we'd like to take a username and turn it into a KTH ID, because the 
group-member methods use KTH IDs.
<<UG methods>>=
def find_user_by_username(self, username):
  """
  Finds a user by username.
  Returns a list of matching user objects.
  """
  response = self.__session.get(f"{self.BASE_URL}/api/ug/users"
    f"?$filter=username eq '{username}' or emailAliases eq '{username}'")
  return response.json()
@

The resulting JSON object has the following format.
\begin{pycode}
user = ug.find_user_by_username("dbosk")

print(r"\begin{minted}{json}")
print(json.dumps(user, indent=2))
print(r"\end{minted}")
\end{pycode}

We test this method as follows.
<<test functions>>=
def test_find_user_by_username():
  data = ug.find_user_by_username("dbosk")
  assert data[0]["username"] == "dbosk"
  assert data[0]["givenName"] == "Daniel"
  data = ug.find_user_by_username("alba")
  assert data[0]["username"] == "alba"
  assert data[0]["givenName"] == "Alexander"
@

This makes a simple CLI command.
We simply execute the method with the supplied argument and print the result.
Due to the [[eq]] in the request above, we get a list with only one element.
We also want to remove the [[memberOf]] value, since that clutters the output 
and is not that useful anyway.
<<add commands to cli>>=
@cli.command(name="user")
def cli_user(username: str):
  """
  Prints info about user with username `username`.
  """
  <<create UGsession instance ug or exit>>

  try:
    user_data = ug.find_user_by_username(username)[0]
  except IndexError as err:
    logging.error(f"Can't find user {username}.")
    sys.exit(1)

  del user_data["memberOf"]
  print(user_data)
@


\section{Members of groups}

We can do two things with the members of a group:
\begin{enumerate}
\item list them,
\item change them (set, add or remove).
\end{enumerate}
We have separate methods for these in [[UGsession]].
For the CLI, we'll add each as a subcommand to a [[members]] command.
We want something like this:
\begin{minted}[linenos=false]{text}
kthutils ug members ls group
kthutils ug members set group user1 user1 ... userN
kthutils ug members add group userX
kthutils ug members rm group userX
\end{minted}

This means that we should add another layer of Typer.
We'll add a Typer instance [[members]] that we'll add subcommands too, and 
we'll add this [[members]] to [[cli]].
Then we get the hierarchy we want.
<<add commands to cli>>=
members = typer.Typer(name="members",
                      help="Operations on the members of a group")
cli.add_typer(members)

<<common variables for members>>
@

All of these commands will take similar arguments.
We see two types: the group name and a list of users.
For the group name we would like to have a regular expression that matches the 
users name so that we can match several courses at the same time.
<<common variables for members>>=
group_regex_arg = typer.Argument(..., help="Regex for the group's name",
                                autocompletion=complete_group)
user_list_arg = typer.Argument(..., help="List of usernames")
@

This means that we can get the list of matching group names by using the 
[[find_group_by_name]].
<<generate a list [[groups]] from [[group_regex]]>>=
groups = ug.find_group_by_name(group_regex)
@

Now, all of the [[UGsession]] methods take the KTH ID as argument.
But for the CLI, we want to use the more human readable name.
We add a method for translating the [[group_regex]] argument to [[group_kthid]].
We simply go through all groups to find the matching name and its KTH ID.
<<UG methods>>=
def group_name_to_kthid(self, name):
  """
  Takes `name` (e.g. edu.courses.DD.DD1317.20222.1.courseresponsible) and
  returns KTH ID (e.g. u25w6fyq).

  Raises KeyError if no group named `name` is found.
  """
  for group in self.list_editable_groups():
    if group["name"] == name:
      return group["kthid"]
  
  raise KeyError(f"{name} could not be found.")
<<translate [[group_name]] to [[group_kthid]]>>=
group_kthid = ug.group_name_to_kthid(group_name)
@

Now, since most of these methods require KTH ID, we would like to turn a list 
of groups into a list of the corresponding KTH IDs.
<<generate a list of [[group_kthids]] from [[group_regex]]>>=
<<generate a list [[groups]] from [[group_regex]]>>
group_kthids = []
for group in groups:
  group_name = group["name"]
  <<translate [[group_name]] to [[group_kthid]]>>
  group_kthids.append(group_kthid)
@

In the same way, all member methods takes KTH IDs for users as arguments.
We want to translate usernames to KTH IDs.
<<UG methods>>=
def usernames_to_kthids(self, usernames):
  """
  Takes a list of usernames,
  returns a list of KTH IDs for the users.
  """
  kthids = []

  for username in usernames:
    try:
      user = self.find_user_by_username(username)[0]
    except IndexError as err:
      <<handle unknown [[username]]>>
    else:
      kthids.append(user["kthid"])

  return kthids
@

Since the username is wrong, we want to raise a [[ValueError]] and include the 
username.
<<handle unknown [[username]]>>=
err = ValueError(f"Can't find user {username}")
err.username = username
raise err
@

\subsection{List members of a group}

The purpose of the groups is the members.
We want to be able to list them.
<<members doc>>=
Returns a list of the members of a group.
The list contains JSON objects.
<<UG methods>>=
def list_group_members(self, group_kthid):
  """
  <<members doc>>
  """
  response = self.__session.get(
    f"{self.BASE_URL}/api/ug/users?$filter=memberOf eq '{group_kthid}'")
  return response.json()
@

The resulting list of JSON objects has the following format.
\begin{pycode}
group = list(
    ug.find_group_by_name("edu.courses.DD.DD1317.20222.1.courseresponsible")
  )[0]
members = ug.list_group_members(group["kthid"])

print(r"\begin{minted}{json}")
print(json.dumps(list(members), indent=2))
print(r"\end{minted}")
\end{pycode}

Now, let's add the CLI command function.
The human readable name is better to use here than the KTH ID used by 
[[.list_group_members]].
We need to add a translation.
We use the function [[complete_group]] from above for the tab completion for 
the name.
<<add commands to cli>>=
@members.command(name="ls")
def cli_list_members(group_regex: str = group_regex_arg):
  """
  <<members doc>>
  """
  <<create UGsession instance ug or exit>>
  <<generate a list of [[group_kthids]] from [[group_regex]]>>
  for group_kthid in group_kthids:
    <<clean and print members>>
@

When printing the members, we don't want to print each member's JSON 
object.
We want something more useful for the terminal.
We print tab-separated fields of data, so that we can use grep(1), cut(1) and 
join(1).

We also note that we must treat the title attribute differently.
The title attribute can sometimes contain empty lists.
(Also interesting about the title attribute is that despite being a list, it 
always seem to contain only one element.)
<<clean and print members>>=
for member in ug.list_group_members(group_kthid):
  try:
    title = member['title']['en'][0]
  except IndexError:
    title = None
  print(f"{member['username']}"
        f"\t{member['kthid']}"
        f"\t{member['givenName']}"
        f"\t{member['surname']}"
        f"\t{title}")
@


\subsection{Set members of a group}

The API doesn't allow us to add or remove individual users.
It only allows us to set a new members list.
<<UG methods>>=
def set_group_members(self, members, group_kthid):
  """
  Sets the group members of group identified by `group_kthid` to be the list of 
  users (strings of kthid for users) `members`.

  """
  headers = self.__session.headers
  headers["content-type"] = "application/merge-patch+json"
  data = {
    "kthid": group_kthid,
    "members": members if isinstance(members, list) \
                       else list(members)
  }

  response = self.__session.patch(
    f"{self.BASE_URL}/api/ug/groups/{group_kthid}",
    data=json.dumps(data), headers=headers)

  if response.status_code != requests.codes.ok:
    raise Exception(f"failed to set members: {response.status_code}: "
                    f"{response.text}")

  return response.json()
@

Now let's add its CLI command function.
<<add commands to cli>>=
@members.command(name="set")
def cli_set_members(group_regex: str = group_regex_arg,
                    users: typing.List[str] = user_list_arg):
  """
  Sets the members of a group. Any existing members not in the list will be 
  removed.
  """
  <<create UGsession instance ug or exit>>
  <<generate a list of [[group_kthids]] from [[group_regex]]>>
  for group_kthid in group_kthids:
    try:
      ug.set_group_members(ug.usernames_to_kthids(users), group_kthid)
    except ValueError as err:
      logging.error(f"Couldn't set users for {group_kthid}: {err}")
@

\subsubsection{Adding users}

It will probably be more useful to provide a method for adding a user or set of 
users.
<<UG methods>>=
def add_group_members(self, new_members, group_kthid):
  """
  Adds list of members in `new_members` (kthids of users) to group with kthid 
  `group_kthid`.

  Returns the updated group data, JSON format.
  """
  current_members = [x["kthid"] for x in self.list_group_members(group_kthid)]
  return self.set_group_members(
            set(current_members + new_members),
            group_kthid)
@

Now let's add its CLI command function.
<<add commands to cli>>=
@members.command(name="add")
def cli_add_members(group_regex: str = group_regex_arg,
                    users: typing.List[str] = user_list_arg):
  """
  Adds the members of a group. Any existing members will remain. Any members 
  already a member, will remain a member.
  """
  <<create UGsession instance ug or exit>>
  <<generate a list of [[group_kthids]] from [[group_regex]]>>
  for group_kthid in group_kthids:
    try:
      ug.add_group_members(ug.usernames_to_kthids(users), group_kthid)
    except ValueError as err:
      logging.error(f"Couldn't add users for {group_kthid}: {err}")
@

\subsubsection{Removing users}

In a similar fashion, we want to remove users too.
<<UG methods>>=
def remove_group_members(self, members, group_kthid):
  """
  Removes the users in `members` (list of kthids) from the group identified by 
  kthid `group_kthid`.

  Returns the updated group data, JSON format.
  """
  current_members = [x["kthid"] for x in self.list_group_members(group_kthid)]
  return self.set_group_members(
            set(current_members) - set(members),
            group_kthid)
@

Now let's add its CLI command function.
<<add commands to cli>>=
@members.command(name="rm")
def cli_remove_members(group_regex: str = group_regex_arg,
                       users: typing.List[str] = user_list_arg):
  """
  Remove the members of a group. Any existing members not named will remain.
  """
  <<create UGsession instance ug or exit>>
  <<generate a list of [[group_kthids]] from [[group_regex]]>>
  for group_kthid in group_kthids:
    try:
      ug.remove_group_members(ug.usernames_to_kthids(users), group_kthid)
    except ValueError as err:
      logging.error(f"Couldn't remove users from {group_kthid}: {err}")
@

\subsection{Tests}

We can test this by adding and removing a user from a group.
<<test functions>>=
def test_add_group_members():
  group = ug.add_group_members(["u13aecix"], "u2i9xt3r")
  assert "u13aecix" in group["members"]
